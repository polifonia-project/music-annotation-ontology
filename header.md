# Music Annotation Ontology

The Music Annotation module provides different music annotation models to accommodate musicological and information retrieval use cases.
The primary objective of this module is to enhance support for other descriptional systems, thus increasing interoperability and conversion possibilities from various music annotation formats. Indeed, all our models are logically interconnected through Music Representation.
